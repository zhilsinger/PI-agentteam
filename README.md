# 🤝 pi-agentteam

**Multi-agent team orchestration for [pi](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono)**

Coordinate a leader with specialized teammates — researcher, planner, and implementer —
each running in a visible psmux pane, collaborating through shared tasks and typed messages.

## ✨ Highlights

| | Feature | |
|---|---|---|
| 🖥️ | **psmux-native swarm** | Each teammate is a real `pi` session in its own pane — watch them work in real time |
| 📋 | **Shared task board** | Create, claim, update, complete — full lifecycle tracking across the team |
| 💬 | **Typed messaging** | `assignment` · `question` · `blocked` · `completion_report` · `fyi` — each with auto-wake semantics |
| 🎯 | **Role-based tool guard** | Researcher (read-only) → Planner (read-only) → Implementer (full tools) — least privilege by default |
| 📡 | **Event-driven wake** | Teammates auto-wake on actionable messages; no polling, no wasted tokens |
| 📊 | **Interactive `/team` panel** | Browse members, tasks, mailbox — all from a keyboard-driven dashboard |
| 🔗 | **Peer handoff** | Workers coordinate directly (researcher → planner) without going through the leader |
| 🧹 | **Zero footprint** | One folder, file-based state, no database — delete and it's gone |

---

## 📦 Install

```bash
pi install npm:pi-agentteam
```

**Requirements:** [pi](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono) ≥ 0.60 · [psmux](https://github.com/psmux/psmux)

> `psmux` is a native Windows tmux alternative and supports tmux-compatible CLI syntax used by this project.

## 🚀 Quick Start

```text
You (leader):
  Create a team and spawn a researcher to analyze the build pipeline.

  > agentteam_create("my-project", { description: "Optimize the build pipeline" })
  > agentteam_spawn({ name: "research", role: "researcher",
                      task: "Analyze the build pipeline and report bottlenecks" })
  > agentteam_spawn({ name: "plan", role: "planner" })

  ... researcher works in its own psmux pane ...

  > agentteam_send({ to: "plan", message: "Research done, draft an optimization plan",
                     type: "fyi" })

  ... planner drafts plan ...

  > agentteam_receive()   ← pick up completion_report from planner
```

Or open the interactive dashboard:

```text
/team          ← browse members · tasks · mailbox
```

| `l` | Focus leader pane |
| `o` | Toggle detail expansion |
| `s` | Sync leader mailbox |
| `r` | Refresh panel |
| `Esc` | Close panel |

## 💬 Messages & Wake Behavior

Messages carry an implicit **wake hint** that controls how the recipient reacts:

| Type | Purpose | Wake | Typical Flow |
|------|---------|------|--------------|
| `assignment` | Leader → worker task assignment | hard | Leader delegates work |
| `question` | Clarification request | soft | Anyone asks a question |
| `blocked` | Escalation needing attention | hard | Worker hits a wall |
| `completion_report` | Work finished | hard (leader) · soft (teammate) | Worker reports back |
| `fyi` | Informational update | none* | Context sharing |

> \* *Peer handoff exception:* when a non-leader sends `fyi` to an idle teammate, wake is auto-upgraded to `soft` so the handoff doesn't stall silently.

---

## 👥 Built-in Roles

**🔬 researcher** — `read` `grep` `find` `ls` + collab
> Codebase analysis, documentation research

**📋 planner** — `read` `grep` `find` `ls` + collab
> Task decomposition, acceptance criteria

**🛠 implementer** — `read` `grep` `find` `ls` `bash` `edit` `write` + collab
> Code changes, file creation, test runs

> **collab** = `agentteam_send` + `agentteam_receive` + `agentteam_task`
>
> Add custom agents in `.pi/agents/` or `~/.pi/agent/agents/` and use those role names when spawning.

---

## ⚙️ Model Configuration

Create `~/.pi/agent/extensions/agentteam/config.json` to assign models per role:

```json
{
  "agentModels": {
    "planner": "glm-5.1",
    "researcher": "glm-5.1",
    "implementer": "gpt-5.3-codex"
  }
}
```

Values are model selectors from `~/.pi/agent/models.json`. Empty string or missing key = use the default model. The leader always uses your current session model.

### Design Principles

- **Removable** — delete the folder and reload; no core modifications
- **Observable** — each teammate is a visible psmux pane you can watch
- **Minimal prompt burden** — role behavior in markdown, not inflated system prompts
- **File-based state** — JSON + lock files + atomic writes; no database
- **Event-driven** — teammates wake on actionable messages, not polling

## ✅ Tests

```bash
node tests/run.cjs
```

| Suite | Covers |
|-------|--------|
| Tools + state flow | create → spawn → send → receive → task lifecycle |
| Commands | /team, /team-sync, /team-cleanup |
| Protocol + orchestration | Wake defaults, leader digest injection |
| Panel rendering | Visual output across terminal widths |
| Wake + permission guards | Role-based access control |

---

## ⚠️ Limitations

- Workers are separate `pi` sessions in psmux panes, not in-process subagents
- Creating a teammate and starting work are two steps (`spawn` + `send`)
- State is local to one machine (no remote/distributed support)
- Requires psmux (native Windows tmux alternative); tmux-compatible CLI syntax is supported.
